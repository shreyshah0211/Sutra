# Sutra
# Problem 
Medical education is stuck in the past. Despite breakthroughs in modern medicine, we’re still training our medical students with the same methods from decades ago. With these dated and non interactive resources, healthcare students struggle with the transition from exam/theory-heavy curriculum to real patient interaction and on-the-fly clinical reasoning in the field. Studies prove constant confusion for new residents in performance/feedback, standardized study resources, and perioperative planning. The consequence: Medical professionals feeling unprepared when it matters the most—during real-world, high-stakes clinical encounters.  

# Solution
Sutra reimagines medical training through the core idea of learning by doing. The Sutra platform creates realistic patient simulations and hyper-personalized learning environments to enable learning through practice. Sutra provides AI-powered learning through: 
 - Realistic patient case simulations (currently w/live vocal & typed clinical interactions) 
 - AI-generated real-time 3D models, diagrams, and explanations for truly multi-modal learning 
 - Hyper-personalized analytics and feedback on student simulation decisions and diagnosis 
 - Learning environments built around simulation performance 
 - Future integration w/ EHR software to build library of cases & recommend cases based on student background 
 
# Market Opportunity 
There are over 9.8 million healthcare practitioners and continuing medical education learners in the U.S. alone, representing an estimated $7.84 billion annual market. Sutra also targets 826k medical, nursing, and PA students and residents, opening a $661 million opportunity—with even a 0.1% global penetration unlocking tens of millions in annual recurring revenue.
